      <p>
        I started working with simple website layouts in HTML and CSS back in
        2010 and have worked with lots of languages and frameworks since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last five years I've been working outsourced for an audio
        conferencing company as an extension of their development team. We work
        with Java EE apps, keeping them up to date with new features and
        standards and replacing legacy apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        My scrum team works mostly with internal applications that the customer
        uses to schedule conferences, create users, manage access and specific
        features to those conferences as well as provisioning and synchronizing
        with other databases and third party services like Zoom and Cisco.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although most front end apps are not customer facing, every time we get
        a chance we create small POCs consuming something from their APIs to try
        out new techs.

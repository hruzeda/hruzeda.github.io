        <p>
          I learned Java and a bit about Spring Framework and Hibernate back in
          2012 when I worked on Support Inform√°tica converting their ERP
          solution from Cobol/Delphi. I wrote JSP pages and their back ends,
          mirroring screens from the legacy app.

          A few years later I joined Daitan (now Encora) and started working on
          Java back end systems for audio conferencing systems. I worked on:

            powermock and JMockit

            above
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the last few years there, I've also trained interns, interviewed
          experienced Java EE developers to join the company, as well as gave
          support to production issues and CVE upgrades on various systems.

        <p>
          I learned Java and a bit about Spring Framework and Hibernate back in
          2012 when I worked on Support Inform√°tica converting their ERP
          solution from Cobol/Delphi. I wrote JSP pages and their back ends,
          mirroring screens from the legacy app.

          A few years later I joined Daitan (now Encora) and started working on
          Java back end systems for audio conferencing systems. I worked on:

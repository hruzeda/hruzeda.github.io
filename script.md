# Who Am I:

I'm 32 years old now, single parent, living in the countryside of the state of SÃ£o Paulo. It's not the ideal area for developer jobs so I tried moving closer to the capital back in 2015 but being away from my daughter I moved back to her hometown when the pandemic started and I've been working remotely since then.

For the last five years I've been working outsourced for British Telecom as an extension of their development team. We work mostly with legacy apps, slowly updating some and trying to replace others.

My scrum team, specifically, works with internal applications that BT uses to schedule conferences, create users, manage access to those conferences and specific features as well as provisioning and synchronizing with other databases and third party services like Zoom and Cisco.

Front end apps are pretty outdated but, since they're not customer facing, updating them isn't always prioritized. Everytime we get a chance though, we try to create POCs consuming something from their APIs and experimenting with new techs.

# Experiences and projects:

## Frontend

I started programming in an advertising agency back in 2010 customizing PHP templates to different Photoshop layouts and frontend has been my passion ever since.
In the last few years though, working mainly on legacy apps, most of my work is the backend, with very little tweaking of HTML/CSS, Javascript and jQuery here and there.

To avoid losing track of everything that has been happening since ES6, I've been studying and working on personal projects with Angular, React, Redux, Vue, Typescript... moving into javascript backend, I've also studied Node, Express and a few middlewares and even Apollo GraphQL.

### Angular:

I studied Angular back in 2016 when I started helping the team that maintained a VOIP conferencing client that connected to media servers and local devices through a browser extension. The company I worked for asked us to run a small "dojo" as they called it so that every member of the team could investigate a small piece of the framework and share a little of the knowledge or experience they had. The app was already written so we only maintained it, Angular 2 was still being developed so we focused on Angular 1.

We never upgraded after that because, after talking with the customer, considering the learning curve for new developers, we chose to switch to React and write a new client using WebRTC (dropping the browser extension).

Among the improvements and bug fixes I worked on, the one I consider the most relevant was using Microsoft's Azure Communication Services SDK to enumerate devices and handle browser permissions, displaying warnings and errors to the user. I did that by creating a permissions service, storing the user's settings in the local storage to reuse in future calls and adding a few unit tests to cover all that new logic.
